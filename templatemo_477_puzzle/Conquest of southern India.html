               <p>Beginning in 1674, the Marathas launched an aggressive assault, invading Khandesh (October), taking Bijapuri Ponda (April 1675), Karwar (middle of the year), and Kolhapur (end of the year) (July). The Maratha fleet clashed with the Siddis of Janjira in November, but were unable to evict them. Shivaji stormed Athani in April 1676, after recovering from an illness and taking advantage of a civil conflict that had broken out between the Deccanis and the Afghans at Bijapur.</p>
               <p>
                In the run-up to his voyage, Shivaji appealed to a feeling of Deccani patriotism, arguing that Southern India should be safeguarded from outsiders. His plea was partially effective, and in 1677 Shivaji paid a month's visit to Hyderabad and signed a contract with the Qutubshah of the Golkonda sultanate, vowing to renounce his alliance with Bijapur and to jointly combat the Mughals. Shivaji attacked Karnataka in 1677 with 30,000 cavalry and 40,000 soldiers, supported by Golkonda artillery and money. As he moved south, Shivaji captured the forts of Vellore and Gingee, the latter of which would subsequently serve as the Marathas' capital during the reign of his son Rajaram I.</p>

           <p class="section-text">Shivaji planned to reconcile with his half-brother Venkoji (Ekoji I), Shahaji's son by his second wife, Tukabai (née Mohite), who succeeded Shahaji as ruler of Thanjavur (Tanjore). After originally hopeful discussions failed, Shivaji defeated his half-army brother's and captured most of his Mysore plateau territories on November 26, 1677, while returning to Raigad. Dipa Bai, Venkoji's wife, whom Shivaji greatly admired, began new discussions with Shivaji and also persuaded her husband to separate himself from Muslim counsel. In the end, Shivaji agreed to return many of the estates he had taken to her and her female descendants, in exchange for Venkoji agreeing to a series of stipulations for good management of the lands and upkeep of Shahji's tomb (samadhi).</p>

           <h2 class="main-title text-center dark-blue-text">Death and succession</h2>
           <p>The issue of Shivaji's heir-apparent was complex. In 1678, Shivaji imprisoned his son in Panhala, only for the prince to flee with his wife and desert to the Mughals for a year. Sambhaji then went home, unrepentant, and was imprisoned once more in Panhala.</p>
               <p>
                Shivaji died on the eve of Hanuman Jayanti, approximately 3–5 April 1680, at the age of 50. The exact reason of Shivaji's death is unknown. According to British sources, Shivaji died of bloody flux after being unwell for 12 days. The documented cause of death of Shivaji is anthrax, according to a contemporaneous publication in Portuguese, the Biblioteca Nacional de Lisboa. However, Krishnaji Anant Sabhasad, author of Shivaji's biography Sabhasad Bakhar, has listed fever as the cause of Shivaji's death. Putalabai, Shivaji's childless eldest surviving wife, committed sati by plunging into his cremation pyre. Sakwarbai, another surviving spouse, was not permitted to follow suit since she had a small kid.There were also claims, though subsequent academics dismissed them, that his second wife Soyarabai poisoned him in order to install her 10-year-old son Rajaram on the throne.
            </p>
            <p>Soyarabai formed preparations with other administration ministers after Shivaji's death to crown her son Rajaram rather than her stepson Sambhaji. Rajaram, a ten-year-old boy, was seated on the kingdom on April 21, 1680. However, after murdering the commander, Sambhaji gained hold of Raigad Fort, gaining control of Raigad on 18 June and legally ascending the throne on 20 July. Rajaram, his wife Janki Bai, and their mother Soyrabai were imprisoned, and Soyrabai was killed in October on conspiracy accusations.</p>

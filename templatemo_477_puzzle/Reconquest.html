               <p>Shivaji and the Mughals maintained peace till 1670. At the time, Aurangzeb was wary of Shivaji's strong relations to Mu'azzam, whom he suspected of plotting to seize his kingdom and maybe accepting money from Shivaji. At the same time, Aurangzeb, who was preoccupied with fighting the Afghans, drastically decreased his force in the Deccan; many of the dissolved men promptly joined the Maratha army. The Mughals also stole Shivaji's jagir of Berar in order to recoup money owed to him a few years before. In response, Shivaji launched an onslaught against the Mughals, recovering a large amount of the lands lost to them in a four-month period.</p>

           <p class="section-text">In 1670, Shivaji invaded Surat for the second time; the English and Dutch factories repelled his onslaught, but he was able to loot the city itself, including robbing the valuables of a Muslim ruler from Mawara-un-Nahr coming from Mecca. Angered by the increased attacks, the Mughals resumed hostilities with the Marathas, sent a force led by Daud Khan to meet Shivaji on his way home from Surat, but were defeated in the Battle of Vani-Dindori near Nashik.</p>

                Shivaji dispatched his men to annoy the English in Bombay in October 1670; because they refused to provide him war supplies, his forces prevented English woodcutting crews from leaving the city. Shivaji dispatched an ambassador to Bombay in September 1671, this time in search of material for the struggle against Danda-Rajpuri. The English were concerned about the benefits Shivaji would receive from this conquest, but they also did not want to forfeit any possibility of collecting recompense for the plunder of their factories at Rajapur. The English dispatched Lieutenant Stephen Ustick to negotiate with Shivaji, but discussions fell down over the Rajapur indemnity.
                Numerous envoy exchanges occurred over the next few years, with some compromise on the arms concerns in 1674, but Shivaji was never to pay the Rajapur indemnity before his death, and the factory there was closed at the end of 1682.

           <h2 class="section-title">Battles of Umrani and Nesari</h2>
           <p>In 1674, Prataprao Gujar, the Maratha armies' commander-in-chief, was dispatched to repel an invasion army headed by the Bijapuri leader Bahlol Khan. Prataprao's soldiers beat and captured the opposing general in the fight after cutting off their water supply by surrounding a crucial lake, prompting Bahlol Khan to file a peace petition. Despite Shivaji's explicit warnings, Prataprao freed Bahlol Khan, who began planning for a new attack.</p>
               <p>
                Shivaji wrote a scathing letter to Prataprao, refusing him audience until Bahlol Khan was apprehended. Prataprao, angered by his commander's reprimand, tracked down Bahlol Khan and assaulted his position with just six other riders, leaving his entire army behind. Prataprao was slain in battle; when Shivaji learned of Prataprao's death, he was profoundly saddened and arranged for the marriage of his second son, Rajaram, to Prataprao's daughter. Anandrao Mohite was renamed Hambirrao Mohite, and he became the new sarnaubat (commander-in-chief of the Maratha forces). Hiroji Indulkar erected Raigad Fort as the capital of the emerging Maratha state.</p>

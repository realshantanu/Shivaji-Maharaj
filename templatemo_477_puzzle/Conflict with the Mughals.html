               <p>Until 1657, Shivaji maintained peaceful relations with the Mughal Empire. Shivaji offered his assistance to Aurangzeb who then, was the Mughal viceroy of the Deccan and son of the Mughal emperor, in conquering Bijapur in return for formal recognition of his right to the Bijapuri forts and villages under his possession. Dissatisfied with the Mughal response, and receiving a better offer from Bijapur, he launched a raid into the Mughal Deccan.</p>
               <p>
                Shivaji's confrontations with the Mughals began in March 1657, when two of Shivaji's officers raided the Mughal territory near Ahmednagar.This was followed by raids in Junnar, with Shivaji carrying off 300,000 hun in cash and 200 horses.Aurangzeb responded to the raids by sending Nasiri Khan, who defeated the forces of Shivaji at Ahmednagar. However, Aurangzeb's countermeasures against Shivaji were interrupted by the rainy season and his battle of succession with his brothers for the Mughal throne following the illness of the emperor Shah Jahan.</p>

           <h2 class="section-title">Attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat</h2>
           <p class="section-text">In January 1660, at the request of Badi Begum of Bijapur, Aurangzeb, now the Mughal emperor, dispatched his maternal uncle Shaista Khan with an army of over 150,000 men and a formidable artillery division to battle Shivaji alongside Bijapur's army headed by Siddi Jauhar. Shaista Khan conquered Pune with his better–equipped and –supplied force of 80,000 men. He also seized the adjoining fort of Chakan, which he besieged for a month and a half before breaking its walls. Shaista Khan used his advantage of having a bigger, better-equipped, and highly armed Mughal army to seize some Maratha territory, conquering Pune and establishing his home at Shivaji's palace of Lal Mahal.</p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Shivaji made a daring night attack on Shaista Khan's camp on April 5, 1663. He and his 400 men invaded Shaista Khan's residence, breaking into Khan's bedroom and injuring him. Khan had three fingers amputated. Shaista Khan's son, as well as numerous of his wives, servants, and troops, were murdered in the fighting. The Khan sought sanctuary with Mughal soldiers outside of Pune, and Aurangzeb punished him by transferring him to Bengal.</p>
            <p class="section-text">
                In retaliation for Shaista Khan's attacks, and to replenish his now-depleted treasury, in 1664 Shivaji sacked the port city of Surat, a wealthy Mughal trading centre.

           <h2 class="section-title">Treaty of Purandar</h2>
           <p>Aurangzeb was angered at the attacks on Shaista Khan and Surat. In retaliation, he dispatched the Rajput Mirza Raja Jai Singh I with an army of around 15,000 men to defeat Shivaji. Throughout 1665, Jai Singh's armies pressured Shivaji, with cavalry razing the countryside and siege soldiers occupying Shivaji's forts. The Mughal commander was successful in enticing away some of Shivaji's important commanders as well as many of his cavalrymen. By mid-1665, with the bastion of Purandar besieged and on the verge of being captured, Shivaji was obliged to make a deal with Jai Singh.</p>
               <p>
                As the Treaty of Purandar, signed on 11 June 1665 between Shivaji and Jai Singh, Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay the Mughals 400,000 gold hun in recompense. Shivaji decided to become a vassal of the Mughal empire and send his son Sambhaji, together with 5,000 horsemen, to fight as a mansabdar for the Mughals in the Deccan.</p>

           <h2 class="section-title">Arrest in Agra and escape</h2>
           <p class="margin-b-25">Aurangzeb invited Shivaji to Agra (though some accounts say Delhi) in 1666, along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb intended to deploy Shivaji to Kandahar, which is today in Afghanistan, to reinforce the Mughal empire's northern boundary. On the other hand, on 12 May 1666, at the court, Shivaji was forced to stand alongside relatively low-ranking nobles, men he had already vanquished in war. Shivaji took offence and rushed out of court, prompting him to be thrown under home arrest. Ram Singh, Jai Singh's son, guaranteed Shivaji and his son custody.</p>
           <p>
            Under house imprisonment, Shivaji's position was precarious, as Aurangzeb's court deliberated whether to murder him or keep him employed. Jai Singh attempted to sway Aurangzeb's choice after assuring Shivaji of his personal safety. Meanwhile, Shivaji devised a strategy to liberate himself. He returned home with the majority of his warriors, asking Ram Singh to withdraw his pledges to the emperor for the safe custody of himself and his son, and surrendered to Mughal forces.</p>
            <p>Shivaji then feigned to be unwell and began sending out enormous baskets filled with sweets to be distributed as penance to the Brahmins and destitute. Shivaji escaped and fled Agra on August 17, 1666, by placing himself in one of the enormous baskets and his son Sambhaji in another.</p>

   <h2 class="section-title">Peace with the Mughals</h2>
   <p class="about-text">After Shivaji's escape, tensions with the Mughals waned, with Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh serving as a go-between for new peace negotiations between Shivaji and Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb bestowed the title of raja to Shivaji between the years of 1666 and 1668. Sambhaji was also rebuilt as a Mughal mansabdar, complete with 5,000 horses. At the time, Shivaji dispatched Sambhaji along with General Prataprao Gujar to serve under the Mughal viceroy at Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam. Sambhaji was also allocated tax collecting territory in Berar. Aurangzeb also gave Shivaji permission to invade the decaying Adil Shahi; the weaker Sultan Ali Adil Shah II requested peace and awarded Shivaji the privileges of sardeshmukhi and chauthai.</p>
